A RACI chart is a matrix that outlines the involvement of various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. Below is a sample RACI chart for the roles within a BCDR Governance Board:

- **Responsible (R):** The person or role that performs the activity or does the work.
- **Accountable (A):** The person or role that is ultimately answerable for the activity or decision. Only one A can be assigned to each task.
- **Consulted (C):** The people or roles that provide information for the activity and with whom there is two-way communication.
- **Informed (I):** The people or roles that need to be kept up-to-date on progress or completion of the activity, and with whom there is just one-way communication.

Please note, this is a generalized RACI chart, and responsibilities may vary depending on the organization's size, structure, and specific needs. The chart should be reviewed and adapted periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
